# Docs

For performing any of the above functionality, a valid JWT(Json Web Token) should be attached with the request.

## Retrieving a valid JWT(Json Web Token)
 A valid JWT token is returned in response on login request with a dummy user with ```username : 12345``` and ```password : 12345pass``` .
 Login request(```POST```) route : ```http://localhost:3500/login```
 Request body should be in ```JSON``` format.
 Example:
 ```
 {
    "username": "12345",
    "password": "12345pass"
 }
 ```
 
 The response consists of a JWT ,valid for next 2 hours.
 Response looks like:
 ```
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6IjEyMzQ1IiwiaWF0IjoxN.dVVmqmzVPjrht1XPdIqLZnYNqqHd--4"
}
 ```
 
 ## 1. Generate Thumbnail using image URL
 The generated JWT should be attached(as ```Authorization``` Header)  with the request.
 An valid image URL is required for thumbnail.
 Route : ```http://localhost:3500/getThumbnail```
 Request Type : ```POST```
 
 Request example for thumbnail :
 ```Note : Also include JWT as Authorization Header ```
```
{
  "imageUrl":"https://xyz.com/dimage.jpg"
}
```

On successful request,the response will be a thumbnail image.

If image URL is invalid ,then response looks like : 
```
{
  "message": "Something Wrong !.Image Processing Failed"
}
```
 
 In case,JWT is expired or JWT is not passed with request,then response looks like:
 ```
{
    "message": "User not authenticated"
}
 ```
 
 ## 2. UPDATE JSON document using PATCH
 The generated JWT should be attached(as ```Authorization``` Header)  with the request.
 A valid request conatains valid JSON Doc and a PATCH.
 The Response is a UPDATED JSON Doc (generated by applying PATCH on old JSON object)
 Route : ```http://localhost:3500/update```
 Request Type : ```PATCH```
 
 Request example for thumbnail :
 ```Note : Also include JWT as Authorization Header ```
```
{
    "doc": {
        "baz": "qux",
        "foo": "bar"
    },
    "patch": [
        {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "/baz",
            "value": "boo"
        }
    ]
}
```

On success,the response will look like : (for above example)
```
{
    "baz": "boo",
    "foo": "bar"
}
```

If JSON Document or PATCH is invalid ,then response looks like : 
```
{
    "message": "JSON Patching Failed"
}
```
 
 In case,JWT is expired or JWT is not passed with request,then response looks like:
 ```
{
    "message": "User not authenticated"
}
 ```
